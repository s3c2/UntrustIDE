These queries are published in the CodeQL query pack ``codeql/swift-queries`` (`changelog <https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/codeql-cli/latest/swift/ql/src/CHANGELOG.md>`__, `source <https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/codeql-cli/latest/swift/ql/src>`__).

For shorter queries that you can use as building blocks when writing your own queries, see the `example queries in the CodeQL repository <https://github.com/github/codeql/tree/codeql-cli/latest/swift/ql/examples>`__.
