# Adaptive Threat Modeling for JavaScript

This directory contains CodeQL libraries and queries that power adaptive threat modeling for JavaScript.
All APIs are experimental and may change in the future.

Only internal users can run these queries directly. External users can run these queries when performing
JavaScript analysis on Code Scanning. For more information, see
