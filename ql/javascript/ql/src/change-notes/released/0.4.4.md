## 0.4.4

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Added support for `@hapi/glue` and Hapi plugins to the `frameworks/Hapi.qll` library.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug that would cause the extractor to crash when an `import` type is used in
  the `extends` clause of an `interface`.
* Fixed an issue with multi-line strings in YAML files being associated with an invalid location,
  causing alerts related to such strings to appear at the top of the YAML file.
