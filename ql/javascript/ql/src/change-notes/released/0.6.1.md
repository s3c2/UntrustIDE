## 0.6.1

### Minor Analysis Improvements

* Improved the call graph to better handle the case where a function is stored on
  a plain object and subsequently copied to a new host object via an `extend` call.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixes an issue that would cause TypeScript extraction to hang in rare cases when extracting
  code containing recursive generic type aliases.
